# Mosquitto Taster

I needed a way to quickly test my MQTT broker so I put together this simple vite React app to allow basic functionality of a MQTT client. It is not meant to be a full featured MQTT client but rather a quick way to test your broker.

This is a project using Vite, React, Typescript, and TailwindCSS.

you can visit the App's page at mosquittotaster.com

## To use this project

 git clone https://github.com/Dnapert/mosquittoTaster.git
 
 cd mqtt
 
 npm install
 
 npm run dev
